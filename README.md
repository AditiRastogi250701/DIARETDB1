AlexNet implementation on DIARETDB1 database


## DIARETDB1

The database consists of 89 colour fundus images of which 84 contain at least mild non-proliferative signs (Microaneurysms) of the diabetic retinopathy, and 5 are considered as normal which do not contain any signs of the diabetic retinopathy according to all experts who participated in the evaluation. Images were captured using the same 50 degree field-of-view digital fundus camera with varying imaging settings. The data correspond to a good (not necessarily typical) practical situation, where the images are comparable, and can be used to evaluate the general performance of diagnostic methods. This data set is referred to as "calibration level 1 fundus images".


## AlexNet

AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture created by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton in collaboration. AlexNet won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. AlexNet is an 8 layer deep neural network. AlexNets used some new techniques, RelU activation function and Dropout layers.
